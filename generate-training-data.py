# write your code here to open your laptop's camera
# and store images for rock paper scissors

# I would highly recommend storing these images in folders stucture like below:
# training_data\
#           |-- empty\
#           |-- rock\
#           |-- paper\
#           |-- scissors\
# having a folder structure like this will make it easy for you to read the images while pre-processing
